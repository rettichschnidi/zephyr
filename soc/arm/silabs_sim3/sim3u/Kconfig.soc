		If the reset pin was the source of the last reset, delay for 500 msec.
		Firmware can disable the debug port by inadvertantly setting the AHB
		clock source to a disabled clock. If this happens too quickly after a
		reset, it is not possible for a debug agent to gain control and thus
		not possible to reprogram the on-chip flash. Adding a delay here gives
		a debug agent sufficient time to connect.
